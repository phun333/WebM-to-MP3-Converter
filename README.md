# WebM-to-MP3-Converter (I will prepare it in a more explanatory way)
 This script converts .webm audio files from an input folder to .mp3 format, saving them in an output folder. It creates the output folder if it doesn't exist and uses the moviepy library for conversion, printing success or error messages accordingly.
